What i've learned so far today was the function of hashes and how to debunk them.
I really don't understand them as much as I wished I could, but I think I know enough to give a definition of it.
We also used Python a littile bit during one of the lessons, and some of its functions are different than other languages.
Although I only have 1 more day here, i'm gonna try to make the best out of it.
I'm going to miss this place, but but i'll be back here soon in 2 months.
