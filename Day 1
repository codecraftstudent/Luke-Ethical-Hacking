Overall, I think i've learned quite alot from this camp.
I've learned what cookies are and how to debunk them.
I've also learned how ethical and unethical hacking is.
I'm having fun learning more about code in this camp, and I hope to learn more about it.
And the people i've met here are also pretty intresting.
One thing I want to know more about is how to differenciate code and cookies from each other.
aIt is only the first day, but I can already tell that these next 3 days are going to be exciting.
